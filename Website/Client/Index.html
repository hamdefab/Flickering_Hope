                  In the city of Tokyo, the protagonist was walking to the
                  convenience store, but as they entered the crosswalk, a
                  menacing truck suddenly appeared out of the corner of his eye,
                  rapidly approaching them. In just a few seconds, the
                  protagonist was run over by the truck and the impact sent
                  their body flying into the air and then landed headfirst into
                  the hard concrete surface. The protagonist was knocked
                  unconscious and quickly died from major blood loss and organ
                  failure caused by the impact. Opening up their eyes, all they
                  could see was darkness. The protagonist wondered to themself,
                  “Did I die? Where the hell am I? Am I in Hell?” They tried to
                  move their body, but they couldn’t feel anything. But then,
                  suddenly, many glowing, alien-like eyeballs were watching him.
                  And then they heard a weird static screeching sound and soon
                  realized that the scary eyeballs were communicating to each
                  other. While they could not recognize the language, they were
                  able to understand that terrifying beings were going to decide
                  their fate and watch them with great interest. A feeling of
                  tiredness and fear from all these strange events overwhelmed
                  them and soon fainted. The protagonist opened their eyes and
                  saw the lush green scenery of a forest with a stream of water
                  rushing by. In an unfamiliar area, the protagonist tried to
                  quickly get up to ascertain their current situation. However
                  the protagonist came to suddenly realize that their body was
                  no longer what they were used to. When they tried to start
                  walking, they quickly tripped and fell into the dirt since
                  their sense of balance was different than what it should have
                  been. Looking at their arms and legs, they were much shorter
                  than what they should have been. Crawling towards the river,
                  they looked at their reflection and saw a face that was not
                  theirs. Confused, they started to panic as they tried to
                  recall their memories. But to their horror, their memories
                  didn’t seem to be intact, as if there were giant gaps in their
                  place. They couldn’t even remember their name and only knew
                  that they had been living in a completely different place with
                  their family. Breaking down from this terrible situation,
                  tears started overflowing from their eyes. They curled up into
                  a fetal position and started processing all the emotions they
                  had been suppressing: fear, grief, and despair. However after
                  an hour of grieving, the protagonist stood up and felt a great
                  surge of anger. It was then they snapped and shouted to the
                  heavens, “I will do whatever it takes to get back home. And
                  anything that gets in my way will be crushed!” They decided to
                  give themself the name Elpis, as a reminder of the
                  determination to achieve their hope to return home to their
                  family. With newfound courage, our intrepid hero took the
                  first step on their journey, a decision that would change the
                  world.

                  The player controls the protagonist Elpis and explores the
                  world of Algos looking for a way to return home. During the
                  exploration, Elpis will find clues related to the lore of the
                  world and encounter monsters which she will have to fight.
                  Starting out, Elpis was given a fragment of life and a
                  fragment of death by the god, Aether. Those two fragments
                  grant Elpis great physical strength and access to magical
                  prowess. Elpis can gain more strength by acquiring more
                  fragments from bosses enemies, whether they be monster or
                  human. Additionally, Elpis has a blazing hope that was born
                  from the strength of her conviction. This hope allows Elpis to
                  revive even after death, but with each death, Elpis’s hope
                  will shrink. However, Elpis’s hope can recover with each boss
                  kill and events that help Elpis reach her goal to return home.
